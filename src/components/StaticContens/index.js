The key to finding the cause of the leak is to try to identify where the water is coming from and exactly when in the cycle it appears, explains Jeffrey McBride, a Sears Home Services laundry expert."
			},
			{
				title: "1. The hoses arenâ€™t secure.",
				image: "",
				content: "Check your hoses first. The fill hoses are normally located at the rear of the washer. Are the threaded fittings tightened? The drain hose is also located at the rear of the machine and may not be properly installed into the household drain. Verify that the leak is not caused by a restricted household drain thatâ€™s backing up through the standpipe."
			},
			{
				title: "2. The door isnâ€™t fully closed or the door seal is damaged.",
				image: "",
				content: "Water coming from the door is the easiest to spot. First, make sure the door is fully closed. Is a sock trapped between the seal and the door? Problem solved. If the door is closed all the way, check the seal itself for erosion or damage. If the seal looks fine, try cleaning it. Bits of cotton, undissolved washing machine detergent, hair and other small offenders can all cause a leak. Use a scouring pad or a similar object to clean the door as well."

			{
				title: "3. The water pressure is too high.",
				image: "",
				content: "When a soap drawer leaks on a front-load washer, it will almost invariably be for one of two reasons: Either the incoming water pressure is too high, causing water to spill over the top, or something is blocking the flow of water. Simple fix? Turn the water pressure down a bit using the tap at the connection point for your washing machine."
			},
			{
				title: "4. The dispenser is blocked.",

				content: "Usually, using too much detergent will cause a blockage in the dispenser drawer, which will, in turn, make the water overflow. Clean the drawer with hot water and a brush."

				title: "5. Youâ€™re using too much detergent.",
				image: "",

				content: "Top Load machines and front load machines require different detergents. Different kinds of washing machine manuals indicate what kind of detergent will work best with that particular model, yet so many people do not even bother to go through the complete manual and end up using the wrong detergent for years. This leads to the machine not performing to its best capacity of cleaning. Also, some detergents are too harsh for delicate natural fabrics, so you should keep this in mind too. Similarly, detergents designed for delicate wash might not clean the tougher garments efficiently."

				title: "3. Wrong amount of detergent",

				content: "Most detergents and washing machines come with the recommendation of the optimal amount of detergent to be used per load. It should be obvious using less detergent will lead to clothes not properly cleaned, but using more detergent does not equate cleaner clothes either, in fact, itâ€™s the other way around. Too many detergents may leave residue on your clothes which will appear as suds. Pay attention to the correct measurement of detergent recommended for each load for the best results."

Not all clothes can be machine washed and even if they can be, specific water temperature is more suitable to wash them or they might need to be put in a light load or require a rinse afterwards.

Sort your clothes beforehand, not just the whites and colours but also sort them according to fabric type and how dirty the particular article is. Be mindful of what settings you are using for each load."

If you have not been inspecting your machine for faults and repairs every month you might be responsible for the poorly washed clothes. You also need to clean your washing machine from inside at least every other week. This will ensure there is no lint or residue accumulated and nothing is catching rust or mould. A machine in good condition will need less water, less detergent and will clean clothes better."
